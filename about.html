    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We at Asharna scented candle, are passionate about creating candles that not only fill your space with captivating fragrances but also prioritize the use of soy wax instead of petroleum wax.

      We believe in providing you with a clean and eco-friendly candle experience.

      Our candles are handcrafted with love, using 100% natural soy wax derived from soybean oil. By choosing soy wax, we ensure that our candles burn longer, cleaner, and emit less soot compared to traditional petroleum-based candles. You can enjoy a longer-lasting and healthier candle experience without compromising on the delightful scents.

      We take pride in our meticulous attention to detail, from selecting premium fragrance oils to hand-pouring each candle with care. Whether you're looking to create a cozy atmosphere, unwind after a long day, or simply add a touch of elegance to your space, our scented soy wax candles are here to elevate your moments.
